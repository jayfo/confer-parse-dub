Within applications, I tried to make the interface simpler by reducing the number of commands, making them more general (\"universal\"), and making their options and parameters visible with dialog boxes.

While the sources of information have continued to evolve over the years from libraries, to web search engines, to virtual assistants, many important challenges and opportunities remain. The success of any information retrieval systems depends critically on both the ability to support people in articulating their information needs and making sense of the results to solve the problem that motivated their search in the first place, as well as the need to efficiently and effectively find relevant information. My research combines these two dimensions into an interdisciplinary, user-centered perspective on information systems.<br>My interest in information retrieval started in the early 1980's with the observation that different people use a surprisingly wide variety of words to describe the same object or concept. This fundamental characteristic of human language set limits on how well simple word-matching techniques can do in satisfying information needs. In a paper at the pre-CHI Gaithersburg conference in 1982 [6] we describe this problem as statistical semantics. (It is symptomatic of the problem that we subsequently used vocabulary mismatch, verbal disagreement, and statistical semantics to refer to the same problem.) Over the next decade, with colleagues at Bell Labs, I developed and evaluated solutions that involved collecting multiple descriptors for objects, and reducing the dimensionality of the representation using techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [3][7] to mitigate the disagreement between the vocabulary that authors use in writing and searchers use to express their information needs. Similar approaches (combined with a lot more data and compute) are used to power modern word-embedding techniques that widely used in natural language processing.","authors":[{"institutions":["Microsoft Research"],"personId":37076}]},{"title":"SIGCHI Social Impact Award Talk: Sustainability and SIGCHI","trackId":10924,"typeId":11537,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36886,"abstract":"Some years ago, I began to read environmental philosophy such as deep ecology and Marxist interpretations. At the time I did not know what to do with this material, but my tree hugging instincts and experience of having seen my rural grandparents live a decent but very simple life inspired an abiding interest in the topics these philosophers were writing about. My grandparents grew a lot of their own food, kept an ancient car that my grandfather maintained, and enjoyed strong social ties with family and friends. It seems now that we must develop our own forms of simplicity and self-reliance if we are to weather the devastations the market economy is visiting on the planet. When I discovered computing colleagues worried about the same environmental issues I was, we collaborated to create the Computing within LIMITS community.<br>LIMITS is a series of workshops focused on how to use computing tools and strategies to address global environmental problems. Inspired by the classic 1972 Limits to Growth report (itself a product of computing), the premise is that we must accept and embrace the reality that we live on a finite planet. That reality must inform and animate our work. The first LIMITS Workshop was held in 2015, with one each year since. The Sixth Annual Workshop is in June.<br>Most computing research does not address or take into account the finiteness of Earth. In 2018, I first authored a paper with LIMITS colleagues for Communications of the ACM to discuss this matter. I was skeptical of acceptance, but perhaps it is a sign of the times that reviewers were surprisingly positive. The paper argues that problems of sustainability are socioeconomic in origin, and we can turn to the field of ecological economics to set a course. In a subsequent paper, \"Design in the Age of Climate Change,\" I examined social movements that consider sustainability within an economic frame, such as the post-growth movement in Europe, the Transition Town movement, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. These movements draw from earlier ideas such as Gandhi's notion of abundance within simplicity.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, Irvine"],"personId":37076}]},{"title":"SIGCHI Social Impact Award Talk: A Call to Action","trackId":10924,"typeId":11537,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36887,"abstract":"Our world has been animated and enriched by digital technologies used for creativity, collaboration, learning, health, politics, and commerce. Yet there is much that is troubling. We depend upon software that nobody truly understands and that is vulnerable to hackers and cyberterrorism. Privacy has been overrun by governments and surveillance capitalism. Our children are addicted to their devices; we have become workaholics. Jobs and livelihoods are being demolished without adequate social safety nets. A few digital technology leviathans threated to control not only their domains, but all commerce. Among all these issues, I am most deeply concerned about the hype associated with modern artificial intelligence, and the risks to society stemming from premature use of AI software. We are particularly vulnerable in domains such as medical diagnosis, criminal justice, seniors care, driving, and warfare. Here AI applications have begun or are imminent. Yet much current AIs are unreliable and inconsistent, without common sense; deceptive in hiding that they are algorithms and not people; mute and unable to explain decisions and actions; unfair and unjust; free from accountability and responsibility; and used but not trusted. Happily, we are not helpless victims of forces totally outside our control. We can raise our voices as citizens; we can enact procedures and legislation as a society.

These stimuli are caused by our manual interaction with the material, they are therefore closely coupled to our actions. Similarly, if we are subjected to a vibrotactile stimulus with a frequency directly coupled to our actions, we do not experience vibration – instead we experience this as a material property. My thesis explores this phenomenon of 'material experience' in three parts. Part I contributes two novel devices, a flexible phone which provides haptic feedback as it is being deformed, and a system which can track a finger and simultaniously provide haptic feedback. Part II investigates how vibration is perceived, when coupled to motion: what are the effects of varying feedback parameters and what are the effects of different types of motion? Part III reflects and contextualizes the findings presented in the previous sections. In this extended abstract I briefly outline the most important aspects of my thesis and questions I've left unanswered, while also reflecting on the writing process.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Copenhagen & Saarland University, Saarland Informatics Campus"],"personId":37076}]},{"title":"SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award: Evaluating Experiences of Autistic Children with Technologies in Co-Design","trackId":10924,"typeId":11537,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36889,"abstract":"Many technologies available to autistic children functionally focus on the medical characteristics of a diagnosis of autism. All too often, these technologies are not oriented towards their specific modes of sense-making, but rather towards an outcome behaviour defined by a neurotypically dominant society [7]. These technologies are then also evaluated according to the extrinsic motivations driving their design. Recently, though, more and more Participatory Design (PD) projects create technologies together with autistic children, albeit still mostly remaining in a medicalised view of autism. Hence, there is a lack of research into participatory design with autistic children aiming to develop technologies that reflect their intrinsic interests, holistic wellbeingand considers the embodied experiences they have with these technologies.<br>Constructive notions of experience in the research field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) rely on empathy as a core component of experience-driven evaluations [2]. However, autistic individuals perceive the world differently and, hence, make sense of it differently than non-autistic researchers [1]. This divide becomes especially pronounced when working with children, whose life worlds vastly differ from those of adult researchers. While empathy is a core requirement for the evaluation of the experience of autistic children, my work shows that researchers cannot rely solely on their empathy. Hence, evaluating these experiences requires a structured process capturing multiple views [6].","authors":[{"institutions":["Vienna University of Technology"],"personId":37076}]},{"title":"CUI@CHI: Mapping Grand Challenges for the Conversational User Interface Community","trackId":10916,"typeId":11351,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32992,"abstract":"The aim of this workshop is twofold.

Fundamentally, it seeks to improve the human species, yet the impacts of such movement are unknown and the implications on children's lives and technologies were not explored deeply. In an age, where technologies such as under-skin chips or brain-machine interfaces can clearly be defined as transhumanist, our aim is to reveal probable pitfalls and benefits of those technologies on children's lives by using the power of design fiction.

In turn, this challenges the assumed targeted audience, intentionality, and pedagogical approaches of traditional HCI educational structures. Drawing from Latin American decolonial thinking, we reflect on our experiences as Latin American students seeking a graduate education in the United States. From there, we discuss paths for HCI educators and students to engage with the co-creation of pluriversal learning spaces that resist universal notions of language, class content, and knowledge production. As we build a more inclusive research community, these discussions become critical for imagining an HCI education aware of its social and political dimensions.","authors":[{"institutions":["Georgia Institute of Technology & Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral"],"personId":30811},{"institutions":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"personId":32915},{"institutions":["Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral"],"personId":33923}]},{"title":"Machine Learning for Non-Programmers","trackId":10922,"typeId":11345,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":33087,"abstract":"Machine learning (ML) for data analysis have attracted the HCI community in the recent years.

Specifically, we embed the memories of an elderly woman inside a micro-organism by means of computing and genetic engineering. To do so, we first encoded the stories into a string of nucleotides. We next designed and fabricated a circular string by appending restriction enzymes and backbone genes. We developed specific bio-protocols to insert the fabricated molecule inside Komagataeibacter rhaeticus bacteria. The transformed bacteria were presented in an exhibition as a sculpture – Semina Aeternitatis, containing billions of copies of the original stories that people could see, touch, smell and taste. Our work is a first step towards a future where the interaction with our past will go beyond words, and take a more tangible format.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Colorado Boulder"],"personId":33886},{"institutions":["Aalto University"],"personId":33785}]},{"title":"Speculative Designs for Emergent Personal Data Trails: Signs, Signals and Signifiers","trackId":10916,"typeId":11351,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":33118,"abstract":"As networked sensing technologies continue to infiltrate new corners of the built environment, innocuous daily activities —turning on a light, streaming TV, commuting— increasingly create personal data trails.

However, with the reframing of climate change as a climate crisis, environmental concerns have become increasingly pervasive in the community. In 2019 CHI introduced a sustainability role and set a goal to make CHI more sustainable. In 2020 CHI is in Hawaii. This work looks back over the last two decades and estimates what are substantial and growing CO2 emissions from conference travel. First, it posits how, in the short term, potential environmental damage can be minimised. Second, and longer-term, it invites the community to reflect on research dissemination and how the conference experience may need to change.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Cambridge"],"personId":33770}]},{"title":"Dealing with Ethical Challenges in HCI Fieldwork","trackId":10922,"typeId":11345,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":33148,"abstract":"We are witnessing an increase in fieldwork within the field of HCI, particularly involving marginalized or under-represented populations.

We seek to bring together a group of industry and academic collaborators, bringing new competences to HCI around the exciting opportunities of redesigning our contemporary mobilities.","authors":[{"institutions":["Stockholm University"],"personId":34000},{"institutions":["Stockholm University"],"personId":30452},{"institutions":["Stockholm University"],"personId":31441},{"institutions":["Edinburgh University"],"personId":33993},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":33636},{"institutions":["Halmstad University"],"personId":33782},{"institutions":["Nissan Research Laboratory"],"personId":33631},{"institutions":["Chalmers University"],"personId":33694}]},{"title":"Upon Not Opening The Black Box","trackId":10923,"typeId":11535,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":33175,"abstract":"On the eve of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect we, a university laboratory, marked the occasion with an interactive installation called Compliance.

However, it is difficult to improve the performance of recognizing cross-subject emotion due to subjectivity and the noise associated with EEG data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition method with combination of channel-wise features and LSTM. The channel-wise feature is defined by the symmetric matrix, the element of which is calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient between two-pair channels to consider the spatial interaction among all channels. Then, the channel-wise features are fed to the 2-layer stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which can extract temporal features and learns an emotional model that can complementarily handle subjectivity and noise. The experiments on two publicly available datasets DEAP and SEED demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined use of channel-wise features and LSTM. Experimental results achieve state-of-the-art classification rate of 98.93% and 99.10% over 2-classes valence and arousal on DEAP respectively and show the accuracy of 99.63% over 3-classes classification on SEED.","authors":[{"institutions":["Konkuk University"],"personId":33974}]},{"title":"SGC02: TimeBOMB: An Interactive Game Station Showcasing the History of Computer Games","trackId":10914,"typeId":11536,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34040,"abstract":"We present TimeBOMB, an interactive game station that enables players to experience the history of computers and video game development.

Designing scatterplots for large data sets is challenging, as overlapping markers are likely to cause loss of information. Poorly chosen marker opacity, shape, or size may lead to e.g. overplotting or diminished visibility of outliers. The challenge is amplified by having to wait for rendering every time the design is changed. To reduce designer effort, optimisation-based approaches to scatterplot design have been proposed, most comprehensive being an algorithm by Micallef et al.

However, their approach suffers also from poor rendering performance, discouraging usage in interactive applications.

For seniors, it is necessary to have a good social network and continuous physical activities to maintain good overall health. Currently, although some older adults depend on community centers to meet these needs, they still sometimes feel less connected with others. In this paper, we design the game, Team Bingo, that aims to reduce social isolation and increase physical activity among seniors in a community setting.","authors":[{"institutions":["Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis"],"personId":33798},{"institutions":["Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis"],"personId":33728}]},{"title":"SRC11: Facilitating Physical-Computer System Design through Data-Driven Natural-Language Interaction","trackId":10914,"typeId":11536,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34069,"abstract":"Designing and creating physical computing system can be challenging for novice user.In this paper, we present FritzBot, an intelligent conversational agent offering assistance for novice users on constructing physical-computing systems through natural-language interaction.

Fertility tracking is often impacted by different social factors and taboos, and it has been progressively assisted by consumer health technologies. My dissertation research combines multiple studies focusing on understanding the data practices, the influence of technology, and the consequences of using fertility-related personal data and technology in self-tracking for fertility. Based on my findings, I plan to explore how design and technology can be used to reinforce positive experiences, avoid negative emotional burden, and support holistic tracking for fertility.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, Irvine"],"personId":34455}]},{"title":"DC12: Participatory Design Tools: Exploring the Value of Design through Materiality","trackId":10915,"typeId":11539,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34498,"abstract":"As participatory design (PD) approaches become a normative part of contemporary business practice, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that PD tools and methods are accessible and understandable to a larger audience, to fully mobilise and harness their value.

However, when it comes to designing celebratory technology for eating – i.e. technology that celebrates the experiential and in particular often playful aspects of eating , the use of sound has been mostly underexplored. My PhD research explores the opportunity to use interactive technology to enrich playful eating experiences through sounds. Via a research-through-design approach, I designed and evaluated two systems that generate digital sounds as a result of eating ice cream, contributing to our understanding of the design of interactive gustosonic experiences. I hope that this work can guide designers in creating gustosonic experiences supporting a more playful relationship with food.","authors":[{"institutions":["RMIT University"],"personId":34457}]},{"title":"DC01: Creative Expression with Immersive 3D Interactions","trackId":10915,"typeId":11539,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34531,"abstract":"Virtual and augmented realities (VR/AR) allow artists to create 3D content in a three-dimensional space  both display and inputs are 3D.

Therefore, it is very important for them to maintain their physical prowess by encouraging the performance of physical activity. Previous research has focused primarily on physical activity as a single task without consideration of numerous additional coinciding events that almost always co-occur. The most common concomitant, secondary task (i.e., dual-task) is related to the cognitive requirements associated with daily activity pursuits. Thus, any procedure designed to promote greater physical activity should include complex tasks. In addition, the older population is diverse, and therefore, physical activity should be personalized according to individual capabilities and skills. We intend to combine navigation as a secondary task to walking, as a task \"instructor\", guiding the users through their personalized routes and also provide an added value of doing physical activity outside the home.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Haifa"],"personId":34463}]},{"title":"DC15: A Design Philosophy for Agents in the Smart Home","trackId":10915,"typeId":11539,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34533,"abstract":"The home is often the most private space in people's lives, and not one in which they expect to be surveilled.

The contribution aims to develop a suite of strong concepts that can be used to inform design practice and subsequent development of PD tools.","authors":[{"institutions":["The University of Queensland"],"personId":33676}]},{"title":"DC16: Print-and-Play: 3D-printed Interactive Objects Without Assembly or Calibration","trackId":10915,"typeId":11539,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34598,"abstract":"In recent years, 3D-printing technology has become widely accessible to non-experts and hobbyists, enabling them to fabricate objects of varying geometries.

With my work, I explore what I call \\pap: 3D-printed interactive objects without requiring any post-print activities such as assembly or calibration. I approach this by by externally sensing how the user's actions interact with well-studied physical phenomena (e.g., acoustic resonance and fluid dynamics). I have developed two novel techniques using this principle: , a blow-based interaction technique for fabricated objects using acoustic resonance; and , a technique for fabricating touch-sensitive objects using pneumatic sensing and fluid dynamics principles.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Copenhagen"],"personId":29020}]},{"title":"DC06: Giving Form to Temporality: Extending Design Practices and Methodologies for 'Slow' Interaction","trackId":10915,"typeId":11539,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":34599,"abstract":"With an aim to extend and enlarge the slow technology concept, this overview describes my dissertation goal of exploring the diversity of temporal design within HCI.

We asked 30 participants to drive in a simulation environment using voice guidance that gives three types of suggestions: familiar, optimal, and new routes.

Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible block in a composition is occluded by at least 50% or perspectively distorted by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size.

Drivers' subjective ratings of their takeover performance were treated as the ground truth. The best random forest model had an accuracy of 70.2% and an F1-score of 70.1%. We also discussed the implications on the design of an adaptive in-vehicle alert system.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":35538},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":35620},{"institutions":["State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company"],"personId":35446},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":34794},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":30571},{"institutions":["University of Massachusetts"],"personId":35082},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":34685}]},{"title":"LBW139: Designing User Interface for Facilitating Live Editing in Streaming","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35761,"abstract":"Media assets, such as overlay graphics or comments, can make video streaming a unique and engaging experience.

However, the increasing occurrence of large-scale disasters, overwhelm local medical systems and patients find themselves without timely access to medical expertise. To respond to this problem medical care experts are exploring telemedicine, which typically attempts to use synchronous audiovisual communication. While current telemedicine approaches have limited ability to impact the physical care required for trauma, AR technology allows medical professionals to see their patients while seeing additional digital information. In this paper we describe ARTEMIS (Augmented Reality Technology to Enable reMote Integrated Surgery), an immersive AR-VR telementoring infrastructure that allows experienced surgeons to remotely aid less experienced medical professionals in the field. ARTEMIS provides Mixed Reality immersive visual aids by tracking a patient in real-time and showing a reconstructed 3D point cloud in a VR environment; expert surgeons can interact with the 3D point cloud representation of the patient, instruct the remote novice through real-time 3D annotations projected in AR on the patient's body, using hand-maneuvers shown in AR through an avatar of the expert surgeon, and by projecting small video clips of specific procedures in the AR space for the novice to follow.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35411},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35096},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35223},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35004},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35678},{"institutions":["Naval Medical Center San Diego"],"personId":35584},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":34740},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":35532},{"institutions":["University of California, San Diego"],"personId":34657}]},{"title":"LBW322: Urban Immersion: A Web-based Crowdsourcing Platform for Collecting Urban Space Perception Data","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35789,"abstract":"We introduce Urban Immersion, a web-based platform for collecting crowdsourcing immersive perception data of urban space.

Meanwhile, it features a context-trigger mechanism of ESM as a backup to remind users of labeling. Our preliminary evaluation of CAR with nine participants, who collected and labeled their mobility activity data for 15 weekdays, showed that compared with PART and ESM, participants collected a larger amount of annotated mobility data using CAR. In addition, participants had a higher annotation rate when using CAR than when using ESM. Our results show that the hybrid approach that combines manual and automated recording is promising. Our future work is validating these results and measure more metrics related to compliance with more participants.","authors":[{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":35634},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":30283},{"institutions":["University of Michigan ?

Furthermore, specific weight shift patterns that can express certain human emotions and intentions are revealed. These findings will be useful for designing effective weight shifts to enhance emotional and intentional messaging between users. This study attempts to open a new dimension for the expression capability of robotic gadgets.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Tsukuba"],"personId":26728},{"institutions":["University of Tsukuba"],"personId":31371}]},{"title":"LBW302: ATHack: Co-Design and Education in Assistive Technology Development","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35852,"abstract":"ATHack, an annual assistive technologies hackathon at MIT, is unique in that community members living with disabilities (co-designers) propose projects and work with hackers to create prototypes over a two-week period.

We also found that designers leverage feedback topic and sentiment, and the status of the provider to aid interpretation. Based on the findings, we created a new tool (Decipher) that enables designers to visualize and navigate a collection of feedback using its topic and sentiment structure. In a preliminary evaluation (N=20), we found that Decipher helped users feel less overwhelmed during feedback interpretation tasks and better attend to critical issues and conflicting opinions compared to using a typical document-editing tool.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"personId":28433},{"institutions":["Adobe Research"],"personId":26029},{"institutions":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"personId":27650}]},{"title":"Leveraging Error Correction in Voice-based Text Entry by Talk-and-Gaze","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31782,"abstract":"We present the design and evaluation of Talk-and-Gaze (TaG), a method for selecting and correcting errors with voice and gaze.

The proposed method enables the user's face to be captured by an internal camera while blocking the scenery from the user's view using orthogonal polarizing plates.

One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term.","authors":[{"institutions":["Aalborg University"],"personId":37001},{"institutions":["Aalborg University"],"personId":36903},{"institutions":["Aalborg University"],"personId":28329}]},{"title":"LBW144: Jill Watson SA: Design and Evaluation of a Virtual Agent to Build Communities Among Online Learners","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35884,"abstract":"Despite being accessible and affordable, online education presents numerous challenges for online learners due to the absence of face-to-face interactions.

Like for other sports, watching esports has become a new kind of entertainment medium, which is possible due to platforms that allow gamers to live stream their gameplay, the most popular platform being Twitch.tv. On these platforms, users can comment on streams in real-time and thereby express their opinion about the events in the stream. Due to the popularity of Twitch.tv, this can be a valuable source of feedback for streamers aiming to improve their reception in a gaming-oriented audience. In this work, we explore the possibility of deriving feedback for video streams on Twitch.tv by ana- lyzing the sentiment of live text comments made by stream viewers in highly active channels. Automatic sen- timent analysis on these comments is a challenging task, as one can compare the language used in Twitch.tv with that used by an audience in a stadium, shouting as loud as possible in sometimes non-organized ways. This language is very different from common English, mixing Internet slang and gaming-related language with abbreviations, intentional and unintentional grammatical and orthographic mistakes as well as emoji- like images called emotes. Classic lexicon based sentiment analysis techniques therefore fail when applied to Twitch comments. In order to overcome the challenge posed by the non-standard language, we propose two unsupervised lexicon based approaches that make heavy use of the information encoded in emotes, as well as a weakly supervised neural network based classifier trained on the lexicon based outputs, that is supposed to help generalization to unknown words by use of domain-specific word embeddings. To enable better understand- ing of Twitch.tv comments, we analyze a large dataset of comments, uncovering specific properties of their language and provide a smaller set of comments labeled with sentiment information by crowd sourcing. We present two case studies showing the effectiveness of our methods in generating sentiment trajectories for events live-streamed on Twitch.tv that correlate well with specific topics in the given stream. This allows for a new kind of implicit real-time feedback gathering for Twitch streamers and companies producing games or streaming content on Twitch. We make our datasets as well as our code publicly available for further research.","authors":[{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36957},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36969},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36944},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36946},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36948},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36913},{"institutions":["Julius-Maximilians University"],"personId":36987}]},{"title":"LBW236: Assessing the Experience of People with Autism at the Canada Science and Technology Museum","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35886,"abstract":"To provide universal accessibility, public community spaces such as museums must be designed considering the experience of all patrons, including visitors living with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

It is often easier and faster than a dedicated quality assurance team, and its output is more realistic than that of automated testing. However, crowds of testers working in parallel tend to focus on a small set of commonly-used User Interface (UI) navigation paths, which can lead to low test coverage and redundant effort. In this paper, we introduce two techniques to increase crowd testers' coverage: interactive event-flow graphs and GUI-level guidance. The interactive event-flow graphs track and aggregate every tester's interactions into a single directed graph that visualizes the cases that have already been explored. Crowd testers can interact with the graphs to find new navigation paths and increase the coverage of the created tests. We also use the graphs to augment the GUI (GUI-level guidance) to help testers avoid only exploring common paths. Our evaluation with 30 crowd testers on 11 different test pages shows that the techniques can help testers avoid redundant effort while also increasing untrained testers' coverage by 55%. These techniques can help us develop more robust software that works in more mission-critical settings not only by performing more thorough testing with the same effort that has been put in before but also by integrating them into different parts of the development pipeline to make more reliable software in the early development stage.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":30127},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":31111},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":31452},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":30892},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":27124}]},{"title":"LBW123: Who Uses Bots?

Through this workshop we aim to explore opportunities for research, promote interdisciplinary exchange, increase awareness, and establish a community on the subject matter.","authors":[{"institutions":["AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH & University of Vienna"],"personId":28907},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology & University of Applied Arts Vienna"],"personId":27752},{"institutions":["Freelance Researcher"],"personId":33958},{"institutions":["KU Leuven"],"personId":29856},{"institutions":["Ontario Tech University"],"personId":30249},{"institutions":["YouTube"],"personId":33652},{"institutions":["University of Salzburg"],"personId":26947}]},{"title":"Watch+Strap: Extending Smartwatches with Interactive StrapDisplays","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31820,"abstract":"While smartwatches are widely adopted these days, their input and output space remains fairly limited by their screen size. We present StrapDisplays—interactive watchbands with embedded display and touch technologies—that enhance commodity watches and extend their input and output capabilities. After introducing the physical design space of these StrapDisplays, we explore how to combine a smartwatch and straps in a synergistic Watch+Strap system. Specifically, we propose multiple interface concepts that consider promising content distributions, interaction techniques, usage types, and display roles. For example, the straps can enrich watch apps, display visualizations, provide glanceable feedback, or help avoiding occlusion issues. Further, we provide a modular research platform incorporating three StrapDisplay prototypes and a flexible web-based software architecture, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. Early brainstorming sessions with 15 participants informed our design process, while later interviews with six experts supported our concepts and provided valuable feedback for future developments.","authors":[{"institutions":["Technische Universität Dresden"],"personId":28817},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Dresden"],"personId":30829},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Dresden"],"personId":27004}]},{"title":"LBW110: Family Group Chat: Family Needs to Manage Contact and Conflict","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35916,"abstract":"Many instant messaging applications offer group chat feature where members can share messages and make voice or video calls with a group of social contacts.

Yet, these affordances may also undermine public values such as privacy and displace human agency in governance procedures. In this paper, the conflicts regarding the governance of communities which collectively manage and produce a commons are discussed through the case of a fictional energy community. Three mechanisms are identified in this process: tracking use of and contributions to the commons; managing resources, and negotiating the underlying rule sets and user rights. Our effort is aimed at contributing to the HCI community by introducing a framework of three mechanisms and six design dilemmas that can aid in balancing conflicting values in the design of local platforms for commons-based resource management.","authors":[{"institutions":["Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"],"personId":26512},{"institutions":["Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"],"personId":28086},{"institutions":["Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"],"personId":26281},{"institutions":["Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"],"personId":30358},{"institutions":["Avans Hogeschool"],"personId":29634}]},{"title":"LBW225: Living Paper: Authoring AR Narratives Across Digital and Tangible Media","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35918,"abstract":"Storytelling is an important means for children to build literacy while sharing beliefs, values, and cultural norms.

Unlike conventional social signals such as profile bios, S3s use computational summarization to reduce receiver costs and raise the cost of faking signals. To demonstrate and explore the concept, we built Sig, an extensible Chrome extension that computes and visualizes S3s. After a formative study, we conducted a field deployment of Sig on Twitter, targeting two well-known problems on social media: toxic accounts and misinformation. Results show that Sig reduced receiver costs, added important signals beyond conventionally available ones, and that a few users felt safer using Twitter as a result.

The primary way of gathering user feedback is through bug reports and peer reviews, as formal usability testing is prohibitively expensive to conduct in practice. Participants expressed a strong desire to gather real-world use cases and understand users' mental models, but there was a lack of tool support for such needs. In particular, participants were curious about where users got stuck, their workarounds, common mistakes, and unanticipated corner cases. We highlight several opportunities to address those unmet needs, including developing new mechanisms that systematically elicit users' mental models, building mining frameworks that identify recurring patterns beyond shallow statistics about API usage, and exploring alternative design choices made in similar libraries.","authors":[{"institutions":["Harvard University"],"personId":29528},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":27678},{"institutions":["University of California, Los Angeles"],"personId":27042},{"institutions":["Harvard University"],"personId":28455}]},{"title":"LBW212: 4DTexture: A Shape-Changing Fabrication Method for 3D Surfaces with Texture","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35922,"abstract":"4D printing with a hobbyist FDM printer has enabled a rapid fabrication and self-assembly process for 3D shapes.

In this paper, we introduce 4DTexture, a novel design and fabrication approach that integrates texture design through the 4D printing process. Compared to conventional 3D printing surfaces with texture, which usually requires support structures, 4DTexture can effectively reduce production material, time and the post-process effort after printing. Specifically, 4DTexture prints flat substrates with a customized texture design on its top surfaces, which can easily be triggered and can self-morph to target 3D shapes. Overall, our approach enables the design and fabrication of 3D surfaces with texture and can be leveraged by designers and researchers in the field of personal fabrication.","authors":[{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":35522},{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":35360},{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":35298},{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":35248},{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":35064},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":34680},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":35444}]},{"title":"\"It's in my other hand!\"  Studying the Interplay of Interaction Techniques and Multi-Tablet Activities","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31827,"abstract":"Cross-device interaction with tablets is a popular topic in HCI research.

We have introduced 2.5D representation to apply convolutional neural network methods on a capacitive image of the curved surface, and two types of network architectures based on recent achievements in the computer vision field were evaluated with our dataset. We also implemented real-time interactive applications using the prototype and demonstrated the possibility of intuitive interaction using fingers in VR applications.","authors":[{"institutions":["Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc."],"personId":27070},{"institutions":["Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc."],"personId":30734}]},{"title":"LBW350: Where Are My Parents?

ElastOscillation consists of a proxy, six elastic bands and DC motors. It leverages the motors to control the bands' elasticity to restrain the movement of the proxy, which is connected with the bands. Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in corresponding ranges of movement. The users then perceive the force from oscillation at different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. We conducted a force perception study to understand users' distinguishability for perceiving oscillation forces in 1D and 2D movement, respectively. Based on the results, we performed a VR experience study to show that the force feedback provided by ElastOscillation enhances VR realism.","authors":[{"institutions":["National Chengchi University"],"personId":31670},{"institutions":["National Taiwan University"],"personId":27837},{"institutions":["National Taiwan University"],"personId":30537},{"institutions":["National Taiwan University"],"personId":31520}]},{"title":"User Experience Design Patterns for Pseudo-Sentient Agents","trackId":10919,"typeId":11343,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31879,"abstract":"Software agents with truly human-level intelligence may be years or decades away — or a practical impossibility.

We found that BVI users were better able to understand the geometric, spatial and structural circuit information using TangibleCircuits, as well as enjoyed learning with our tool.","authors":[{"institutions":["Dartmouth College"],"personId":27275},{"institutions":["Dartmouth College"],"personId":29884},{"institutions":["Dartmouth College & Beijing University"],"personId":31127},{"institutions":["Dartmouth College & Tsinghua University"],"personId":26249},{"institutions":["Dartmouth College & Boston University"],"personId":28630},{"institutions":["Boston University"],"personId":26590},{"institutions":["Dartmouth College"],"personId":25739}]},{"title":"LBW003: Training Technology Probes Across Fitness Practices: Yoga, Circus and Weightlifting","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":35990,"abstract":"Wearable technology for sports and fitness have increased in popularity in the last decade, but most technological solutions in research are designed for a single specific fitness practice and target group.

By analyzing over 100,000 Reddit posts and comments in r/AppalachianTrail and applying a Sense of Community theory, we sought to understand hikers' identity as community members, how their emotional and practical needs are met, and how they evolve. We found that the role and language of thru-hikers change as they progress from pre-hike, on-hike, and post-hike stages, from a questioner early on, to an expert post-hike. We conclude with design recommendations to support offline communities online.","authors":[{"institutions":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"personId":26414},{"institutions":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"personId":30613},{"institutions":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"personId":25915},{"institutions":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"],"personId":28685}]},{"title":"LBW042: Empirical Investigation of Users' Preferred Timing Parameters for American Sign Language Animations","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36003,"abstract":"To make it easier to add American Sign Language (ASL) to websites, which would increase information accessibility for many Deaf users, we investigate software to semi-automatically produce ASL animation from an easy-to-update script of the message, requiring us to automatically select the speed and timing for the animation.

In principle, teleoperated robots could be perceived differently than autonomous robots because they embody a human agent. To investigate this aspect, we conducted a 2 (voice pitch: original vs. high) × 2 (voice gender: male vs. female) × 2 (user gender: male vs. female) between- participants experiment to study the effects of the robot voice pitch, robot voice gender, and user gender on the attitudinal responses of the users toward a teleoperated robot and the associated decision-making. It was observed that the male and female participants perceived a high-pitched voice differently. The users' awareness of the robot being teleoperated and persuasiveness of the robot were noted to be related, which may provide a plausible explanation for the interaction effects between the voice pitch and user gender.","authors":[{"institutions":["CyberAgent, Inc."],"personId":33622},{"institutions":["CyberAgent, Inc."],"personId":33705},{"institutions":["Osaka University"],"personId":33697},{"institutions":["Osaka University"],"personId":33687},{"institutions":["Osaka University"],"personId":33876}]},{"title":"Infrastructural Speculations: Tactics for Designing and Interrogating Lifeworlds","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31908,"abstract":"This paper introduces \"infrastructural speculations,\" an orientation toward speculative design that considers the complex and long-lived relationships of technologies with broader systems, beyond moments of immediate invention and design.

If it does, how should it navigate issues of privacy and control? Designers currently lack guidelines to help them design appropriate agent behaviors. We used Speed Dating to explore inchoate social mores around agent actions within a home, including issues of proactivity, interpersonal conflict, and agent prevarication. Findings offer new insights on how more socially sophisticated agents might sense, make judgements about, and navigate social roles and individuals. We discuss how our findings might impact future research and future agent behaviors.","authors":[{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":25841},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":31208},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":31704},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":28931},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":27567},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":30346}]},{"title":"Stop and Smell the Chalk Flowers: A Robotic Probe for Investigating Urban Interaction with Physicalised Displays","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31920,"abstract":"HCI researchers have begun to more systematically study non-digital transient approaches for displaying information in public space, for example, in the form of chalk infographics.

Finally, in an overall discussion, we suggest how technology-provided encouragement and awareness can be personalised given the capability to automatically monitor the relevant states, towards addressing the barriers that they pose. In addition, we highlight movement behaviour features to be tracked to provide technology with information necessary for such personalisation.","authors":[{"institutions":["University College London"],"personId":37010},{"institutions":["University College London"],"personId":36898},{"institutions":["University College London"],"personId":31309},{"institutions":["University College London"],"personId":30011},{"institutions":["University of East Anglia"],"personId":36943},{"institutions":["University College London"],"personId":36910}]},{"title":"Agency of Autistic Children in Technology Research—A Critical Literature Review","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":31932,"abstract":"Autistic children are increasingly a focus of technology research within the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. We provide a critical review of the purposes of these technologies and how they discursively conceptualise the agency of autistic children. Through our analysis, we establish six categories of these purposes: behaviour analysis, assistive technologies, education, social skills, therapy and well-being. Further, our discussion of these purposes shows how the technologies embody normative expectations of a neurotypical society, which predominantly views autism as a medical deficit in need of ‘correction’. Autistic children—purportedly the beneficiaries of these technologies—thus become a secondary audience to the largely externally defined purposes. We identify a lack of design for technologies that are geared towards the interests, needs and desires of autistic children. To move HCI’s research into autism beyond this, we provide guidance on how to consider agency in use and explicitly allow for appropriation beyond externally driven goals.","authors":[{"institutions":["TU Wien"],"personId":30906},{"institutions":["TU Wien"],"personId":36937},{"institutions":["University of Washington"],"personId":32777},{"institutions":["TU Wien"],"personId":27421}]},{"title":"LBW297: A Formative Study on Designing Accurate and Natural Figure Captioning Systems","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36028,"abstract":"Automatic figure captioning is widely useful for improving the readability and accessibility of figures.

Encompassing a broad spectrum of technologies and applications, AI poses many challenges for HCI and design. One such challenge is the need to make AI's role in a given system legible to the user in a meaningful way. In this paper we employ a Research through Design (RtD) approach to explore how this might be achieved. Building on contemporary concerns and a thorough exploration of related research, our RtD process reflects on designing imagery intended to help increase AI legibility for users. The paper makes three contributions. First, we thoroughly explore prior research in order to critically unpack the AI legibility problem space. Second, we respond with design proposals whose aim is to enhance the legibility, to users, of systems using AI. Third, we explore the role of design-led enquiry as a tool for critically exploring the intersection between HCI and AI research.","authors":[{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":31522},{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":28799},{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":31298},{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":26327}]},{"title":"LBW316: Are All the Frames Equally Important?","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36040,"abstract":"In this work, we address the problem of measuring and predicting temporal video saliency - a metric which defines the importance of a video frame for human attention. Unlike the conventional spatial saliency which defines the location of the salient regions within a frame (as it is done for still images), temporal saliency considers importance of a frame as a whole and may not exist apart from context. The proposed interface is an interactive cursor-based algorithm for collecting experimental data about temporal saliency. We collect the first human responses and perform their analysis. As a result, we show that qualitatively, the produced scores have very explicit meaning of the semantic changes in a frame, while quantitatively being highly correlated between all the observers.<br>Apart from that, we show that the proposed tool can simultaneously collect fixations similar to the ones produced by eye-tracker in a more affordable way. Further, this approach may be used for creation of first temporal saliency datasets which will allow training computational predictive algorithms. The proposed interface does not rely on any special equipment, which allows to run it remotely and cover a wide audience.","authors":[{"institutions":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"personId":34664},{"institutions":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"personId":35573},{"institutions":["Adobe Research"],"personId":35409},{"institutions":["Harvard University"],"personId":37073}]},{"title":"LBW021: Supporting Online Video Learning with Concept Map-based Recommendation of Learning Path","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36041,"abstract":"People increasingly use online video platforms, e.g., YouTube, to locate educational videos to acquire knowledge or skills to meet personal learning needs.

Addressing this gap in the literature is one of the chief aims of the article. Drawing on an original six-week study with 42 participants utilizing a bespoke LBSN entitled ‘GeoMoments’, our research explores: (1) the way that territoriality is linked to self-identity; and (2) how this interplay affects the interactions between users as well as the environments they inhabit. Our findings suggest that participants affirmed their self-identity by selectively posting and claiming ownership of their neighborhood through the LBSN. Here, the locative decisions made related to risk, hierarchies, and the users’ relationship to the area. This practice then led participants to discover and interact with the digital information overlaying their physical environments in a playful manner. These interactions demonstrate the perceived power structures that are facilitated by identity claims over a virtual area. In the main, our results reaffirm that territoriality is a central concept in understanding LBSN use, while also drawing attention to the temporality involved in user-to-user and user-to-place interactions pertaining to physical place mediated by LBSN.","authors":[{"institutions":["Rochester Institute of Technology"],"personId":29131},{"institutions":["University of Nottingham"],"personId":25669},{"institutions":["Utrecht University"],"personId":31144},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":29209},{"institutions":["City University London"],"personId":27484},{"institutions":["Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"],"personId":36929},{"institutions":["Xi'an Jiaotong - Liverpool University"],"personId":36955},{"institutions":["Rochester Institute of Technology"],"personId":37018}]},{"title":"INT045: airMorphologies: A Wearable Device for Social Interaction in Air Polluted Environments","trackId":10917,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":36044,"abstract":"A facial mask, as part of the daily outfit for people living in an air polluted environment, has become a barrier for social interaction and self-expression. airMorphologies, a pneumatic wearable device, shapes our body language and the manner of social interaction.

This combination enables Telewalk to be applied even within a physical space of 3m x 3m. Utilizing the head rotation as input device enables directional changes without any physical turns to keep the user always on an optimal circular path inside the real world while freely walking inside the virtual one. In a user study we found that even though motion sickness susceptible participants reported respective symptoms, Telewalk did result in stronger feelings of presence and immersion and was seen as more natural then Teleportation.","authors":[{"institutions":["Ulm University"],"personId":31600},{"institutions":["Ulm University"],"personId":30999},{"institutions":["Ulm University"],"personId":29286},{"institutions":["University of Ulm"],"personId":30104}]},{"title":"KI/OSK: Practice Study of Load Sensitive Board for Farmers Market","trackId":10918,"typeId":11344,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32005,"abstract":"In recent years, the retail industry has increasingly gained interest in the ICT system for enriching the customers' shopping experience and is now being deployed in some stores.

Drawing on gender and queer theories from sociology and Science and Technology studies, we consider how NLG can contribute towards the advancement of gender equity in society. We propose a conceptual framework and technical parameters for aligning NLG with feminist HCI qualities. We present three approaches: (1) adhering to current approaches of removing sensitive gender attributes, (2) steering gender differences away from the norm, and (3) queering gender by troubling stereotypes. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these approaches across three hypothetical scenarios; newspaper headlines, job advertisements, and chatbots. We conclude by discussing considerations for implementing this framework and related ethical and equity agendas.","authors":[{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":26310},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":28225},{"institutions":["The Australian National University & Data61 CSIRO"],"personId":26817},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":26045}]},{"title":"\"You Don't Have To Know My Past\": How WeChat Moments Users Manage Their Evolving Self-Presentation","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32054,"abstract":"Most social media platforms record, display, and archive users' personal histories.

We compared the effectiveness of a manual versus a muscle interface for eleven users without and three users with motor impairments performing continuous tasks. Both user groups preferred and performed better with the muscle versus the manual interface for the complex continuous task.

We (re)introduce these liminal and ambiguous creatures, and discuss their relation to ML. We offer a background to designers' use of metaphor, and show how the technology-as-monster metaphor can generatively probe and (re)frame the questions ML poses. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through a detailed discussion of an early-stage generative design workshop inquiring into ML approaches to supporting student mental health and well-being.","authors":[{"institutions":["New York University"],"personId":28896},{"institutions":["New York University"],"personId":26523}]},{"title":"Community Collectives: Low-tech Social Support for Digitally-Engaged Entrepreneurship","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32102,"abstract":"With the rise of social media, entrepreneurs are feeling the pressure to adopt digital tools for their work.

We compare two of these designs with an \"off-face\" olfactory necklace and evaluate their social acceptance, comfort as well as perceived odor intensity for both the wearer and observer.","authors":[{"institutions":["Zhejiang University"],"personId":26391},{"institutions":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"personId":26194},{"institutions":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"personId":29165}]},{"title":"Physiologically Driven Storytelling: Concept and Software Tool","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32126,"abstract":"We put forth Physiologically Driven Storytelling, a new approach to interactive storytelling where narratives adaptively unfold based on the reader's physiological state.

These findings have implications for user experience designers and researchers, as well as those interested in new brainstorming and system evaluation methods.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":33775},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":33813},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":33699}]},{"title":"A Human Touch: Social Touch Increases the Perceived Human-likeness of Agents in Virtual Reality","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32149,"abstract":"Virtual Reality experiences and games present believable virtual environments based on graphical quality, spatial audio, and interactivity. The interaction with in-game characters, controlled by computers (agents) or humans (avatars), is an important part of VR experiences. Pre-captured motion sequences increase the visual humanoid resemblance. However, this still precludes realistic social interactions (eye contact, imitation of body language), particularly for agents. We aim to make social interaction more realistic via social touch. Social touch is non-verbal, conveys feelings and signals (coexistence, closure, intimacy). In our research, we created an artificial hand to apply social touch in a repeatable and controlled fashion to investigate its effect on the perceived human-likeness of avatars and agents. Our results show that social touch is effective to further blur the boundary between computer- and human-controlled virtual characters and contributes to experiences that closely resemble human-to-human interactions.","authors":[{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":26166},{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":30292},{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":31178},{"institutions":["University of Konstanz"],"personId":29120},{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":27774},{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":26003}]},{"title":"Shaping the Design of Smartphone-Based Interventions for Self-Harm","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32150,"abstract":"Self-harm is a prevalent issue amongst young people, yet it is thought around 40% will never seek professional help due to stigma surrounding it.

Many approaches have been proposed for automatically geolocating users based on their tweets; at the same time, various evaluation metrics have been proposed to measure the effectiveness of these approaches, making it challenging to understand which of these metrics is the most suitable for this task. In this paper, we propose a guide for a standardized evaluation of Twitter user geolocation by analyzing fifteen models and two baselines in a controlled experimental setting. Models are evaluated using ten metrics over four geographic granularities. We use rank correlations to assess the effectiveness of these metrics. Our results demonstrate that the choice of effectiveness metric can have a substantial impact on the conclusions drawn from a geolocation system experiment, potentially leading experimenters to contradictory results about relative effectiveness. We show that for general evaluations, a range of performance metrics should be reported, to ensure that a complete picture of system effectiveness is conveyed. Given the global geographic coverage of this task, we specifically recommend evaluation at micro versus macro levels to measure the impact of the bias in distribution over locations.

In doing so, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI, healthcare and related speech and chatbot domains to collaborate on these key challenges.","authors":[{"institutions":["Macquarie University"],"personId":33855},{"institutions":["Macquarie University"],"personId":33710},{"institutions":["Macquarie University"],"personId":33664},{"institutions":["Macquarie University"],"personId":34025},{"institutions":["University of Washington"],"personId":33916},{"institutions":["Swansea University"],"personId":33671},{"institutions":["IBM Research AI"],"personId":28327},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":26943},{"institutions":["IBM Research"],"personId":33783},{"institutions":["Stanford University"],"personId":33789}]},{"title":"Meeting Designers Where They Are: Using Industry Events as a Research Venue for HCI and Design Methods Development","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32198,"abstract":"There is much work in the CHI community about the 'industry-academia divide', and how to bridge it. One key crossover between HCI/UX scientists and practitioners is the development and use of tools and methods—boundary objects between academia and practice. Among other forms of collaboration, there is an underdeveloped opportunity for academics to make use of industry events (conferences, meetups, design jams) as a research venue in the context of tool and method development. This paper describes three cases from work in academia-industry engagement over the last decade, in which workshops or experiments have been run at industry events as a way of trialling and developing tools directly with practitioners. We discuss advantages of this approach and extract key insights and practical implications, highlighting how the CHI community might use this method more widely, gathering relevant research outcomes while contributing to knowledge exchange between academia and practice.","authors":[{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":25751},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology & University of Luxembourg"],"personId":26413}]},{"title":"Reframing Disability as Competency: Unpacking Everyday Technology Practices of People with Visual Impairments","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32199,"abstract":"More than a billion people in the world live with some form of visual impairment, and a wide variety of technologies are now routinely used by them in the course of 'getting on' in everyday life. However, little is known about the ways in which assistive and non-assistive technologies are brought to bear on material practices. We present findings from a four-month ethnographic study facilitated by a local branch of a UK charity that supports people with visual impairments. Our study explores mainstream and assistive technology use within their everyday lives. We identify three main sites for technology use: social relations and communication practices, textual reading practices, and mobility practices. Via an ethnographic approach we contribute to understanding how people accomplish such practices, and in doing so, uncover the practical competencies that enable people with visual impairments to conduct their everyday activities. Thus we investigate how disability can be thought of in terms of competencies, arguing that understanding of competencies can enrich the design of technologies that fit the needs of people with visual impairments.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Nottingham"],"personId":26924},{"institutions":["University of Nottingham"],"personId":26244},{"institutions":["University of Nottingham"],"personId":28464}]},{"title":"Understanding Cybersecurity Practices in Emergency Departments","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32200,"abstract":"Emergency departments (EDs) have unique operational requirements within hospitals.

The survey collected information relating to authentication and password management, use of personal devices for handling patient data, Internet connectivity on personal and hospital systems, and institutional security policies. Our results show that across multiple hospitals, deployed computer security systems fail to integrate with the requirements of staff and patients, leading to interruptions and inefficiencies.","authors":[{"institutions":["Carleton University"],"personId":30157},{"institutions":["Carleton University"],"personId":31546},{"institutions":["McGill University"],"personId":27088},{"institutions":["McMaster University"],"personId":30746}]},{"title":"Towards Value-Adaptive Instruction: A Data-Driven Method for Addressing Bias in Argument Evaluation Tasks","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32201,"abstract":"As the media landscape is increasingly populated by less than reputable sources of information, educators have turned to argument evaluation training as a potential solution. Unfortunately, the bias literature suggests that our ability to objectively evaluate an argument is, to a large extent, determined by the relationship between our own beliefs and the beliefs latent in the argument we are evaluating. If the argument supports our worldview, we are much more likely to overlook logical errors. Teachers recognize this need to adapt argument evaluation instruction to the specific beliefs of students. For instance, a teacher might intentionally assign a student an argument that the student disagrees with. Unfortunately, this kind of value-adaptive instruction is infrequent due to its unscalability. We propose a novel method for data-driven value-adaptive instruction in instructional technologies. This method can be used to combat bias in real-world contexts and support human reasoning during media consumption.","authors":[{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":28949},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":25547},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":28886}]},{"title":"In Helping a Vulnerable Bot, You Help Yourself: Designing a Social Bot as a Care-Receiver to Promote Mental Health and Reduce Stigma","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32202,"abstract":"Helping others can have a positive effect on both the giver and the receiver.

By responding to the bot, the participants reframed their own negative experiences, reported reduced feelings of danger regarding an individual with depression and increased willingness to help the person, and presented favorable attitudes toward seeking treatment for depression. We discuss design opportunities for accessible social bots that could help users to keep practicing peer support interventions without fear of negative consequences.","authors":[{"institutions":["Seoul National University"],"personId":31077},{"institutions":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":28172},{"institutions":["Seoul National University"],"personId":25585}]},{"title":"QMaps: Engaging Students in Voluntary Question Generation and Linking","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32203,"abstract":"Generating multiple-choice questions is known to improve students' critical thinking and deep learning.

However, it is difficult to arrange fine and complex magnetic fields rapidly. Therefore, we invented a method for fabricating complex geometric magnetic patterns by overlaying multiple magnetic rubber sheets. This method resolves the tradeoff between magnetized pattern complexity and the time required for magnetization. By layering multiple magnetic sheets that have simple magnetic patterns, various types of geometric magnetic patterns, such as checkered and diamond ones, can be generated on the top surface. By applying superposed magnetic fields, various types of tactile stimuli and haptic interaction can be created rapidly. Furthermore, the superposed magnetic fields can be changed dynamically by rotating the layered magnetic sheets. In this paper, we clarify the material requirements and describe the design method for creating these geometric magnetic patterns. We also demonstrate several of their applications.","authors":[{"institutions":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories"],"personId":25668}]},{"title":"Articulating Experience: Reflections from Experts Applying Micro-Phenomenology to Design Research in HCI","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32206,"abstract":"Third wave HCI initiated a slow transformation in the methods of UX research: from widely used quantitative approaches to more recently employed qualitative techniques.

Based on a qualitative study at a community literacy center serving resettled refugees and immigrants, we show that the digital divide framework rests on a distributive logic, one that implies that distributing access to digital technology constitutes a form of social equity. Because this framework only considers valorized goods, skills, and uses, research has frequently ignored the startup, maintenance, and affective costs we found accompanied digital access for our participants. To account for these costs, we propose a theoretical adjustment to the digital divide framework, one where design is an act of configuring both costs and benefits together. We argue that considering such costs enables HCI researchers to engage more effectively with host communities in the non-innocent work of confronting inequity.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, Irvine"],"personId":29100},{"institutions":["University of California, Irvine"],"personId":30156}]},{"title":"Private Responses for Public Sharing: Understanding Self-Presentation and Relational Maintenance via Stories in Social Media","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32212,"abstract":"With nearly two billion users, social media Stories—an ephemeral format of sharing—are increasingly popular and projected to overtake sharing via public feeds.

We found that by combing gaze and gesture cues, our remote collaboration system could provide a significantly stronger sense of co-presence for both the local and remote users than using the gaze cue alone. The combined cues were also rated significantly higher than the gaze in terms of ease of conveying spatial actions.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Auckland"],"personId":25606},{"institutions":["University of Auckland"],"personId":27349},{"institutions":["ETH Zürich"],"personId":29566},{"institutions":["University of Auckland"],"personId":29239}]},{"title":"How Relevant is Hick's Law for HCI?","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32224,"abstract":"Hick's law is a key quantitative law in Psychology that relates reaction time to the logarithm of the number of stimulus-response alternatives in a task.

For example, a virtual hammer's position can be offset to ensure that physical impacts accompany each strike of a virtual nail. We demonstrate the idea by showing that it can be used to create sensations of impact and resistance when driving a virtual nail into a surface, when tightening a virtual screw, and when sawing through a virtual plank.

We highlight a need to broaden the inclusion and support of communities who have different communication needs, including; people with functional communication impairments, neurodiverse people, people who experience adverse life situations or trauma, people who are discriminated against or under-represented, and many, many other individuals and communities. We aim to unpick - and develop pragmatic solutions to - several challenges around working with diverse communities in research and practice, producing functional guidelines for design research in this area and problematising current methods and terminology.","authors":[{"institutions":["Queensland University of Technology"],"personId":31733},{"institutions":["University of Bristol"],"personId":27930},{"institutions":["City, University of London"],"personId":26302},{"institutions":["Queensland University of Technology"],"personId":33635},{"institutions":["TU Wien"],"personId":33673},{"institutions":["Queensland University of Technology"],"personId":27163},{"institutions":["City, University of London"],"personId":28325},{"institutions":["University of Western England"],"personId":33812},{"institutions":["Northumbria University"],"personId":27259}]},{"title":"3D-Auth: Two-Factor Authentication with Personalized 3D-Printed Items","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32248,"abstract":"Two-factor authentication is a widely recommended security mechanism and already offered for different services. However, known methods and physical realizations exhibit considerable usability and customization issues. In this paper, we propose 3D-Auth, a new concept of two-factor authentication. 3D-Auth is based on customizable 3D-printed items that combine two authentication factors in one object. The object bottom contains a uniform grid of conductive dots that are connected to a unique embedded structure inside the item. Based on the interaction with the item, different dots turn into touch-points and form an authentication pattern. This pattern can be recognized by a capacitive touchscreen. Based on an expert design study, we present an interaction space with six categories of possible authentication interactions. In a user study, we demonstrate the feasibility of 3D-Auth items and show that the items are easy to use and the interactions are easy to remember.","authors":[{"institutions":["Technische Universität Darmstadt & Keio University"],"personId":28661},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Darmstadt"],"personId":26017},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Darmstadt"],"personId":25735},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Darmstadt"],"personId":30217},{"institutions":["Keio University"],"personId":29041},{"institutions":["Technische Universität Darmstadt"],"personId":30087}]},{"title":"Utilizing Participant Voice in Volunteer Training","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32249,"abstract":"Delivering training to volunteers is a huge challenge for non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

We describe our experience of designing peer-led training for community volunteers in rural India. Working alongside an NGO involved in community regeneration and social action, we collaboratively delivered a ten-day training workshop, deploying audio technologies to engage the participants in sharing lived experiences. We draw on reflections from trainers and trainees on how utilising participant voice can enhance training. We highlight opportunities around the usage of audio technologies for engaging with participant voice, including the ability to reclaim trainee agency within training and to work within cultural barriers.","authors":[{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":30054},{"institutions":["Newcastle University"],"personId":27536},{"institutions":["Newcastle University"],"personId":27825},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":30890},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":30200}]},{"title":"A Conversation Analysis of Non-Progress and Coping Strategies with a Banking Task-Oriented Chatbot","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32250,"abstract":"Task-oriented chatbots are becoming popular alternatives for fulfilling users' needs, but few studies have investigated how users cope with conversational 'non-progress' (NP) in their daily lives.

In this data, we observed 12 types of conversational NP; five types of content that was unexpected and challenging for the chatbot to recognize; and 10 types of coping strategies. Moreover, we identified specific relationships between NP types and strategies, as well as signs that users were about to abandon the chatbot, including 1) three consecutive incidences of NP, 2) consecutive use of message reformulation or switching subjects, and 3) using message reformulation as the final strategy. Based on these findings, we provide design recommendations for task-oriented chatbots, aimed at reducing NP, guiding users through such NP, and improving user experiences to reduce the cessation of chatbot use.","authors":[{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":31586},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":30721},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":29508},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":26481},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":29771},{"institutions":["National Chiao Tung University"],"personId":30283}]},{"title":"Emotional Footprints of Email Interruptions","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32251,"abstract":"Working in an environment with constant interruptions is known to affect stress, but how do interruptions affect emotional expression?

We studied how 11 participants used our VR game studio in a sedentary workplace over 8-weeks and their perceptions of the experience. We analysed the physical exertion in the VR game studio, comparing this to their step counts from a smartwatch. All participants achieved valuable levels of physical activity and mood benefits. Importantly, for 6 participants, only with the VR game studio did they meet recommended activity levels. Our key contributions are insights about the use of a workplace VR game studio and its health benefits.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Sydney"],"personId":28613},{"institutions":["University of Sydney"],"personId":27561},{"institutions":["University of Sydney"],"personId":31346}]},{"title":"Towards A Design For Life: Redesigning For Reminiscence With Looked After Children","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32253,"abstract":"For 'looked-after' and adopted children, physical objects are often the only remaining link to their pasts; a portal to stories of former families, homes, and events.

We also consider the role of frameworks in HCI as well as the future of the RBI framework.","authors":[{"institutions":["Carleton University"],"personId":36995},{"institutions":["Wellesley College"],"personId":30482},{"institutions":["Worcester Polytechnic Institute"],"personId":36916},{"institutions":["Baylor University"],"personId":36914},{"institutions":["Tufts University"],"personId":36945}]},{"title":"Metaprobes, Metaphysical Workshops and Sketchy Philosophy","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32271,"abstract":"The intersection of philosophy and HCI is a longstanding site of interest for the field that has been attracting special attention in recent years.

A Metaprobe is a design artifact used to study a metaphysical idea without concealing the philosophical tools mobilized by the designers or the designerly knowledge attained after deployment. We introduce the concept of a Metaphysical Workshop. This is the set of sketchy philosophical notions that a designer mobilizes in order to research a philosophical idea through design. We then present a case study that comprises: the philosophical issue under examination, the Metaprobes designed to study it, the metaphysical workshop used and the designerly insight produced.

Unlike traditional forums where comments are displayed asynchronously below a video screen in order of when the comments are posted, danmaku comments are overlaid on the screen and displayed along with the video. This new design creates a pseudo-synchronous effect by displaying asynchronous comments with certain video segments in a synchronous fashion, and the links between danmaku comments and the video segments are defined by users. Danmaku is gaining popularity; however, little is known, compared to the traditional forum design, regarding how effective the new danmaku design is in promoting social interactions among online users. In this work, we collected 38,399 danmaku comments and 16,414 forum comments posted in 2017 on 30 popular videos on Bilibili.com. We compared user participation from different perspectives, e.g., number of comments, sentiment of the comments, language patterns, and ways of knowledge sharing. Our results showed that compared to the traditional linear design, the danmaku design significantly promoted user participation, i.e., there were more users and more comments in danmaku. Additionally, active users posted more positive comments, though they were anonymous; more linguistic memes were used in danmaku, suggesting that it was used to facilitate community-building. In addition to its effectiveness in promoting social interactions, our results also show that danmaku and forum designs play complementary roles in knowledge sharing, where danmaku comments involved more explicit (know-what) knowledge sharing, and forum comments exhibited more tacit (know-how) knowledge sharing. Our findings contribute to the development of social presence theory and have design implications for better social interaction via online videos.","authors":[{"institutions":["Syracuse University"],"personId":37017},{"institutions":["Syracuse University"],"personId":36941},{"institutions":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"],"personId":25619}]},{"title":"The Care Work of Access","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32274,"abstract":"Current approaches to AI and Assistive Technology (AT) often foreground task completion over other encounters such as expressions of care.

To build this understanding, site visits and interviews at local makerspaces, fabrication studios, and workshops were conducted. These visits uncovered the rich practices and roadblocks generated by workshops today. The observations identified the importance of spatial layouts, territoriality and occupant agency, distributed knowledge, and organizational flux, among others, to design and fabrication processes. These observations were further synthesized into one possible direction for such spaces: hybrid workshops (i.e., environments that can leverage computation and responsive architecture to enhance a maker's ability to design and fabricate). This work identifies how such spaces could harness the rich practices and eliminate the challenges found with workshops today and discusses the technical innovations and philosophical questions that hybrid workshops will pose to the future of personal fabrication.","authors":[{"institutions":["MishMashMakers"],"personId":37007},{"institutions":["University of Toronto"],"personId":29519},{"institutions":["University of Toronto"],"personId":28505},{"institutions":["Autodesk Research"],"personId":30585}]},{"title":"The Struggle for Recognition in Advanced Dementia: Implications for Experience-Centered Design","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32279,"abstract":"Focusing on the person with advanced dementia as a social being presents a new opportunity for Experience-Centered Design (ECD), opening design to appreciate the agency and intentional actions of the person with advanced dementia.

This has motivated previous research on developing categories to segment verbalizations into manageable units of analysis. However, the way in which a category might relate to usability problems is currently unclear. In this research, we sought to address this gap in our understanding. We also studied how speech features might relate to usability problems. Through two studies, this research demonstrates that certain patterns of verbalizations are more telling of usability problems than others and that these patterns are robust to different types of test products (i.e., physical devices and digital systems), access to different types of information (i.e., video and audio modality), and the presence or absence of a visualization of verbalizations. The implication is that the verbalization and speech patterns can potentially reduce the time and effort required for analysis by enabling evaluators to focus more on the important aspects of a user’s verbalizations. The patterns could also potentially be used to inform the design of systems to automatically detect when in the recorded think-aloud sessions users experience problems.","authors":[{"institutions":["Rochester Institute of Technology","University of Toronto"],"personId":26778},{"institutions":["University of Toronto"],"personId":36931},{"institutions":["University of Toronto"],"personId":36959},{"institutions":["University of Toronto"],"personId":36985}]},{"title":"Making Maps Available for Play: Analyzing the Design of Game Cartography Interfaces","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32284,"abstract":"Maps in video games have grown into complex interactive systems alongside video games themselves.

One example of when a user's question of \"can I do this?\" may have an answer beyond technological affordances is that of legal constraints. This paper considers an example of this phenomenon: section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States, which criminalizes circumventing copyright protection such as digital rights management (DRM). The DMCA also includes a triennial policymaking process that considers exemptions to the law to protect \"lawful users\" from adverse effects. Through an analysis of public comments of support for exemptions, this paper explores the ways in which users see the law as a hindrance to desired uses of technology. This analysis sheds light on users' expectations for rights of use, how these expectations clash with policy, and what this might mean for technology designers. Drawing lessons from the infrastructure problem in HCI, this paper concludes with laying out solutions that can both work within policy constraints, and more importantly, work to change them.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Colorado Boulder"],"personId":31140}]},{"title":"Confident Privacy Decision-Making in IoT Environments","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32295,"abstract":"Researchers are building IoT systems that aim to raise users' privacy awareness, so that these users can make informed privacy decisions.

We verified that machine learning models trained on privacy decisions made with confidence can produce highly accurate privacy recommendations for users (AUC of 87%).

Each case study exemplifies the differing nature of liminality in everyday contexts and the extent to which increased digitalisation perturbs it in multiple ways. Taking an ethnographic approach, the research engaged with seafarers onboard container ships in European waters, communities in Greenland and welfare claimants in the North East of England. It posits that technological innovation must attend to the routinisation of everyday life through which people establish ontological security if such innovation is to be supportive. The paper thus moves beyond existing HCI scholarship by foregrounding the contextual and relational aspects of social isolation rather than the technological. It does so by advocating a ground-up design process that considers ontological security in relation to notions of liminality among communities on the edge.","authors":[{"institutions":["Royal Holloway University of London"],"personId":29672},{"institutions":["Royal Holloway University of London"],"personId":27368},{"institutions":["Royal Holloway University of London"],"personId":28004},{"institutions":["University of the Arts London"],"personId":26243}]},{"title":"Understanding Older Adults' Participation in Design Workshops","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32319,"abstract":"Design workshops are a popular means of including older adults in technology development.

An in-lab study showed that tutorial authors can successfully use the tool for the unique affordances identified, and provides guidance for designing future tools for tutorial authoring.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":31269},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":28420},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":27410},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":30590},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":27678}]},{"title":"Collaborative Aspects of Collecting and Reflecting on Behavioral Data","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32344,"abstract":"Direct observation of behavior provides a unique type of data for reflecting on during a process of behavioral intervention.

Currently, these systems provide limited guarantees over the execution time, which is problematic for many applications. Timely completion may even be impossible to guarantee due to factors specific to the crowdsourcing platform, such as the availability of workers and concurrent tasks.

These arise from differences between working on procedurally complex tasks in peripersonal space like writing or sketching and being immersed in larger physical spaces where we dwell and engage in body-sized activity like sitting, chatting, and moving about. In Part 2, I explore three types of interface: classical HCI, network interfaces such as context-aware systems, and socio-ecological interfaces. An interface for an architect is a niche that includes the very people who interact with it. In HCI, people are still distinct from the interface. Because of this difference, architectural conceptions may be a fertile playground for HCI. The same holds for interactivity. In Part 3, I discuss why interactivity in HCI is symmetric and transitive. Only in ecological and social interaction is it also reflexive. In ecological interfaces, people co-create bubbles of joint awareness where they share highly situated values, experience, and knowledge.","authors":[{"institutions":["UCSD"],"personId":36973}]},{"title":"Designing to Distract: Can Interactive Technologies Reduce Visitor Anxiety in a Children’s Hospital Setting?","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32405,"abstract":"Many public buildings are entered through reception areas, intended for visitors to sit and wait in to be met.

One approach has been to design for distraction – where displays, surfaces and interactive installations are created to draw visitor’s attention away from their immediate thoughts. However, little is known as to how people respond to such interventions. We present the findings of an ethnographic study that examined the social and psychological effects of using distraction as a design principle in a children’s hospital reception area.

In these occurrences, we categorize 2,668 unique words that modify how “interaction” is used in a sentence. We show that the use of “interaction” is both increasing and diversifying, suggesting the importance of the notion, but also the difficulty in developing theory about interaction. Our findings show that styles of interaction are closely associated with changes in technology and that modalities and characteristics of interaction are becoming more of a topic than specific devices or widgets. Interaction qualities, relating to structure, feel, effectiveness, and efficiency, are consistently prominent, and the quality of novelty is increasingly frequent. From this analysis, we identify open questions about interaction, including how to build knowledge across changing technologies, how to work toward a model of quality for interaction, and what the core of a science of interaction could be.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Copenhagen"],"personId":30509},{"institutions":["University of Copenhagen"],"personId":28277},{"institutions":["Monash University"],"personId":28081},{"institutions":["University of Waterloo"],"personId":31072}]},{"title":"Gendered by Design: A Duoethnographic Study of Personal Fitness Tracking Systems","trackId":10920,"typeId":11534,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32407,"abstract":"Using fitness trackers to generate and collect quantifiable data is a widespread practice aimed at better understanding one’s health and body.

To facilitate this type of interaction, we developed MicroMentor, an on-demand help system that connects users via video chat for 3-minute help sessions. MicroMentor automatically attaches relevant supplementary materials and uses contextual information, such as command history and expertise, to encourage the most qualified users to accept incoming requests. These help sessions are recorded and archived, building a bank of knowledge that can further help a broader audience.

To study the tendency of people to game the system, half of the participants were told their responses would inform social media ranking algorithms. Participants trusted mainstream sources much more than hyper-partisan or fake news sources, and their ratings were highly correlated with professional fact-checker judgments. Critically, informing participants that their responses would influence ranking algorithms did not diminish these results, despite the manipulation increasing the political polarization of trust ratings.","authors":[{"institutions":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"personId":27574},{"institutions":["University of Regina"],"personId":26573},{"institutions":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"],"personId":29115}]},{"title":"Re-Shape: A Method to Teach Data Ethics for Data Science Education","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32448,"abstract":"Data has become central to the technologies and services that human-computer interaction (HCI) designers make, and the ethical use of data in and through these technologies should be given critical attention throughout the design process.

As speech interfaces such as smart speakers are becoming popular, a novel method is required to make users perceive the passing of time as shorter by presenting auditory stimuli. We thus prepared 20 pieces of auditory information as experimental stimuli; that is, 11 auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration but different numbers of 0.1-second sine-wave sounds and 9 other auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration and numbers of sounds but different interval patterns between the sounds. We conducted three experiments to figure out which kinds of auditory stimuli can change users' perception of time passing as shorter. We found that a 10.1-second auditory stimulus that has 0.1-second sine-wave sounds appearing 11 times with intervals between the sounds that narrow rapidly in a linear fashion was perceived as shortest at about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus. We also found that different interval patterns of sounds in auditory information significantly affected users' perception of time passing as shorter, while different numbers of sounds did not.","authors":[{"institutions":["Meiji University"],"personId":29746},{"institutions":["National Institute of Informatics and SOKENDAI"],"personId":27817}]},{"title":"Investigating User-Created Gamification in an Image Tagging Task","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32457,"abstract":"Commonly, gamification is designed by developers and not by end-users.

Insights from critical race theory will inform the discussion. Workshop participants will draft a set of guidelines for research and a set of recommendations for SIGCHI leadership and the CHI community.","authors":[{"institutions":["Northwestern University"],"personId":29053},{"institutions":["Northeastern University"],"personId":33752},{"institutions":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"personId":32915},{"institutions":["Airbnb, Inc."],"personId":33753},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":25587},{"institutions":["Florida State University"],"personId":33873},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":27284},{"institutions":["University of Michigan"],"personId":29867}]},{"title":"Pilot Case Study in Games as Polling Systems, Generating Knowledge about Fake News","trackId":10918,"typeId":11344,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32472,"abstract":"This research reports on heuristics in the design and implementation of games as polling systems.

This paper investigates how domain experts create conceptual diagrams via semi-structured interviews with 18 participants from diverse backgrounds. Our participants create, adapt, and reuse visual representations using both sketches and digital tools. However, they had trouble using current diagramming tools to transition from sketches and reuse components from earlier diagrams. Our participants also expressed frustration with the slow feedback cycles and barriers to automation of their tools. Based on these results, we suggest four opportunities of diagramming tools  exploration support, representation salience, live engagement, and vocabulary correspondence  that together enable a natural diagramming experience. Finally, we discuss possibilities to leverage recent research advances to develop natural diagramming tools.","authors":[{"institutions":["Technion – Israel Institute of Technology"],"personId":28380},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":31123},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":25537},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":28562},{"institutions":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"personId":28951}]},{"title":"Understanding what you feel: A Mobile Audio-Tactile System for Graphics Used at Schools with Students with Visual Impairment","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32476,"abstract":"A lot of information is nowadays presented graphically.

Towards this end, we developed an approach that enables teachers to easily record high-quality audio from their classes. Using this approach, teachers recorded 142 classroom sessions, of which 127 (89%) were usable. Next, we used speech recognition and machine learning to develop teacher-generalizable computer-scored estimates of key dimensions of teacher discourse. We found that automated models were moderately accurate when compared to human coders and that speech recognition errors did not influence performance.

We demonstrate two techniques implemented based on the concept, one with a controller as the primary pointer, and one in which Outline Pursuits are combined with head pointing for hands-free selection. Compared with conventional raycasting, the techniques require less movement for selection as users do not need to reposition themselves for a better line of sight, and selection time and accuracy are less affected when targets become highly occluded.","authors":[{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":29516},{"institutions":["Lancaster University"],"personId":26113},{"institutions":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"],"personId":30276},{"institutions":["Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"],"personId":26786},{"institutions":["Aarhus University"],"personId":29211}]},{"title":"Affective State Prediction Based on Semi-Supervised Learning from Smartphone Touch Data","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32497,"abstract":"Gaining awareness of the user's affective states enables smartphones to support enriched interactions that are sensitive to the user's context.

Using a data collection study with 70 participants on text conversations designed to trigger different affective responses, we developed a variational auto-encoder to learn efficient feature embeddings of two-dimensional heat maps generated from touch data while participants engaged in these conversations.

Yet, scholars have suggested that ordered work sequences can emerge in such settings. We refer to sequences of activities that emerge organically as components of “emergent routines”. The volunteer nature of peer-production, coupled with high degrees of turnover, makes learning and coordination difficult, calling into question the extent to which emergent routines could be ingrained in the community. The objective of this paper is to characterize the work sequences that organically emerge in peer-production, as well as to understand the temporal dynamics of these emergent routine components. We center our empirical investigation on the peer-production of a set of 1,000 Wikipedia articles. Using a dataset of labelled wiki work, we employ Variable-Length Markov Chains (VLMC) to identify sequences of activities exhibiting structural dependence, cluster the sequences to identify components of emergent routines, and then track their prevalence over time. We find that work is organized according to several routine components and that the prevalence of these components changes over time.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Haifa"],"personId":36905},{"institutions":["Stevens Institute of Technology"],"personId":36965},{"institutions":["University of Haifa"],"personId":36951},{"institutions":["Stevens Institute of Technology"],"personId":36904},{"institutions":["University of Haifa"],"personId":36917}]},{"title":"Platform for Studying Self-Repairing Auto-Corrections in Mobile Text Entry through Brain Activity, Gaze, and Context","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32505,"abstract":"Auto-correction is a standard feature of mobile text entry.

However, due to the synchronous nature of online chat, moderators face a high managerial overhead in tasks like discussion stage management, opinion summarization, and consensus-building support. To assist moderators with facilitating a structured discussion for community problem-solving, we introduce SolutionChat, a system that (1) visualizes discussion stages and featured opinions and (2) recommends contextually appropriate moderator messages. Results from a controlled lab study (n=55, 12 groups) suggest that participants' perceived discussion trackability was significantly higher with SolutionChat than without. Also, moderators provided better summarization with less effort and better managerial support using system-generated messages with SolutionChat than without. With SolutionChat, we envision untrained moderators to effectively facilitate chat-based discussions of important community matters.","authors":[{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":28322},{"institutions":["Seoul National University"],"personId":25682},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":27779},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":30031},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":28906},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":31634}]},{"title":"Smart Home Beyond the Home: A Case for Community-Based Access Control","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32520,"abstract":"As smart devices are becoming commonplace in homes, we need to explore the needs of not just the residents of the home, but also of secondary stakeholders who may be granted access to these devices from outside of the home.

To solve this, our device exploits a synergy between ultrasonic jamming and the naturally occur- ring movements that users induce on their wearable devices (e.g., bracelets) as they gesture or walk. We demonstrate that these movements can blur jamming blind spots and increase jamming coverage. Moreover, current jammers are also directional, requiring users to point the jammer to a microphone; instead, our wearable bracelet is built in a ring-layout that al- lows it to jam in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to protect against microphones hidden out of sight.<br>We evaluated our jammer in a series of experiments and found that: (1) it jams in all directions, e.g., our device jams over 87% of the words uttered around it in any direction, while existing devices jam only 30% when not pointed directly at the microphone; (2) it exhibits significantly less blind spots; and, (3) our device induced a feeling of privacy to participants of our user study.

We propose to increase the number of functions that can be triggered with the touch gesture by enabling a smartwatch to identify which finger is being used. We developed MagTouch, a method that uses a magnetometer embedded in an off-the-shelf smartwatch. It measures the magnetic field of a magnet fixed to a ring worn on the middle finger. By combining the measured magnetic field and the touch location on the screen, MagTouch recognizes which finger is being used. The tests demonstrated that MagTouch can differentiate among the three fingers used to make contacts at a success rate of 95.03%.","authors":[{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":30493},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":27971},{"institutions":["University of Virginia"],"personId":30165},{"institutions":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"personId":26314}]},{"title":"Evaluating the End-User Experience of Private Browsing Mode","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32545,"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate why users of private browsing mode misunderstand the benefits and limitations of private browsing.

We also find existing browser disclosures did not explain the primary security goal of private mode. Drawing from the results of our study, we extract a set of recommendations to improve the design of disclosures.","authors":[{"institutions":["University College London (UCL)"],"personId":30854},{"institutions":["Brave Software & Imperial College London"],"personId":27958}]},{"title":"Designing Clinical AAC Tablet Applications with Adults who have Mild Intellectual Disabilities","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32546,"abstract":"Patients with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) face significant communication barriers within primary care services. This has a detrimental effect on the quality of treatment being provided, meaning the consultation process could benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies. However, little research has been conducted in this area beyond that of paper-based aids. We address this by extracting design requirements for a clinical AAC tablet application from n=10 adults with mild ID. Our results show that such technologies can promote communication between general practitioners (GPs) and patients with mild ID by extracting symptoms in advance of the consultation via an accessible questionnaire. These symptoms act as a referent and assist in raising the awareness of conditions commonly overlooked by GPs. Furthermore, the application can support people with ID in identifying and accessing healthcare services. Finally, the participants identified 6 key factors that affect the clarity of medical images.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Strathclyde"],"personId":27025},{"institutions":["University of Strathclyde"],"personId":30447},{"institutions":["University of Edinburgh"],"personId":31261},{"institutions":["University of Strathclyde"],"personId":27073}]},{"title":"Teddy: A System for Interactive Review Analysis","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32547,"abstract":"Reviews are integral to e-commerce services and products.

Our quantitative targeting experiment suggests that twisting is faster than existing headphone button controls and is comparable in speed to a capacitive touch surface. Qualitative interview feedback indicates a preference for I/O Braid's interaction over that of in-line headphone controls.

Drawing on physiological measures, interaction logs, and subjective workload reports, we show that (1) RCEA is perceived to be usable for annotating emotions while mobile video watching, without increasing users' mental workload (2) the resulting time-variant annotations are comparable with intended emotion attributes of the video stimuli (classification error for valence: 8.3%; arousal: 25%). We contribute a validated annotation technique and associated annotation fusion method, that is suitable for collecting fine-grained emotion annotations while users watch mobile videos.","authors":[{"institutions":["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and Delft University of Technology"],"personId":31735},{"institutions":["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)"],"personId":29736},{"institutions":["Xinhuanet"],"personId":31534},{"institutions":["Delft University of Technology"],"personId":29104},{"institutions":["Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and Delft University of Technology"],"personId":25854}]},{"title":"DataQuilt: Extracting Visual Elements from Images to Craft Pictorial Visualizations","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32596,"abstract":"Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the authoring and crafting of personal visualizations.

This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature.

Many are focused on vibrotactile feedback that requires complicated parameter tuning. Another approach is based on mechanical forces created via piezoelectric devices and other methods for non-vibratory haptic sensations like stretching, twisting. These are often bulky with electronic components and associated drivers are complicated with limited control of timing and precision. This paper proposes HapBead, a new on-skin haptic interface that is capable of rendering vibration like tactile feedback using microfluidics. HapBead leverages a microfluidic channel to precisely and agilely oscillate a small bead via liquid flow, which then generates various motion patterns in channel that creates highly tunable haptic sensations on skin. We developed a proof-of-concept design to implement thin, flexible and easily affordable HapBead platform, and verified its haptic rendering capabilities via attaching it to users' fingertips. A study was carried out and confirmed that participants could accurately tell six different haptic patterns rendered by HapBead. HapBead enables new wearable display applications with multiple integrated functionalities such as on-skin haptic doodles, visuo-haptic displays and haptic illusions.","authors":[{"institutions":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"personId":29923},{"institutions":["University of Sussex"],"personId":31081},{"institutions":["Penn State University"],"personId":29494},{"institutions":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"personId":25815},{"institutions":["Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"personId":25849},{"institutions":["Institute of software, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"personId":31552},{"institutions":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"personId":28059},{"institutions":["University of Sussex"],"personId":28193}]},{"title":"Design Systems: A Community Case Study","trackId":10918,"typeId":11344,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32601,"abstract":"Design Systems are an increasingly popular means for technology companies to improve development efficiency and design consistency across their products.

Finally, we discuss how menstrual mobilities are being, and might be, supported through technology-based interventions for a third space, targeting the legibility, literacy, and legitimacy of surrounding environments.","authors":[{"institutions":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi"],"personId":31337},{"institutions":["University of Maryland"],"personId":30591},{"institutions":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi"],"personId":27302},{"institutions":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"personId":27647}]},{"title":"\"In VR, everything is possible!\": Sketching and Simulating Spatially-Aware Interactive Spaces in Virtual Reality","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32617,"abstract":"We propose using virtual reality (VR) as a design tool for sketching and simulating spatially-aware interactive spaces.

These opportunities come with a set of contextual tensions that should inform the design of new technologies for collegiate sports settings.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Maryland"],"personId":31697},{"institutions":["University of Maryland"],"personId":29667},{"institutions":["University of Maryland"],"personId":26094},{"institutions":["University of Maryland"],"personId":29572}]},{"title":"The Silent Conversation: Designing for Introspection and Social Play in Art Museums","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32641,"abstract":"This paper presents an attempt to design for a combination of social play and introspection using a ludic approach within an art museum setting.

Machine Learning approaches only work in narrow domains where labeled training data is available, and non-expert annotators tend to conflate IEC with EML. We introduce an approach, anchor comparison, that leverages workers' ability to identify and remove instances of EML in text to create a paraphrased \"anchor text\", which is then used as a comparison point to classify EML in the original content. We evaluate our approach with a dataset of news-style text snippets and show that precision and recall can be tuned for system builders' needs. Our contribution is a crowdsourcing approach that enables non-expert disentanglement of social references from content.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of Michigan  Ann Arbor"],"personId":30199},{"institutions":["University of Michigan  Ann Arbor"],"personId":28924},{"institutions":["University of Michigan  Ann Arbor"],"personId":30892},{"institutions":["University of Michigan  Ann Arbor"],"personId":26443}]},{"title":"Understanding and Visualizing Data Iteration in Machine Learning","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32643,"abstract":"Successful machine learning (ML) applications require iterations on both modeling and the underlying data.

Unlike jointed systems where angular errors sum with each joint measured, ShArc sensors do not accumulate angular error as more measurement points are added. This allows for inexpensive, robust sensors that can accurately model curves with multiple bends. To demonstrate the efficacy of this technique, we developed a capacitive ShArc sensor and evaluated its performance. We conclude with examples of how ShArc sensors can be employed in applications like gesture input devices, user interface controllers, human motion tracking and angular measurement of free-form objects.","authors":[{"institutions":["Gerogia Institute of Technology & Tactual Labs Co."],"personId":26949},{"institutions":["Tactual Labs Co."],"personId":30993}]},{"title":"Augmenting Static Visualizations with PapARVis Designer","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32647,"abstract":"This paper presents an authoring environment for augmenting static visualizations with virtual content in augmented reality.Augmenting static visualizations can leverage the best of both physical and digital worlds, but its creation currently involves different tools and devices, without any means to explicitly design and debug both static and virtual content simultaneously.

Results recommend the use of an eHMI. A conspicuous appearance of automated-driving capability had no effect for the sample as a whole, although it led to more efficient crossing decisions for those with a more negative attitude towards AVs. Our findings contribute towards the effective design of future AV interfaces.","authors":[{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":26125},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":28143},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":30929},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":26254},{"institutions":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"personId":30010}]},{"title":"Amazon vs. My Brother: How Users of Shared Smart Speakers Perceive and Cope with Privacy Risks","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32666,"abstract":"With the rapid adoption of smart speakers in people's homes, there is a corresponding increase in users' privacy and security concerns. In contrast to previous studies of users' concerns about smart speakers' divulging private information to their manufacturers, our study focused on investigating users' concerns with regard to housemates and external entities. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 participants living in 21 households. Our results suggest that users often have an inadequate understanding of what data their smart speakers makes available to all users and what is kept private. Although participants expressed different privacy concerns about their housemates and external entities, they adopted similar, yet suboptimal, risk management strategies. We provide recommendations for future speaker design to support more optimal coping with the perceived risks.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of British Columbia"],"personId":27338},{"institutions":["University of British Columbia"],"personId":30019},{"institutions":["University of British Columbia"],"personId":28145}]},{"title":"Designers in White Coats: Deploying Ovum, a Fertility Tracking Device","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32667,"abstract":"As self-tracking practices continue to proliferate, there has been a call for a consideration of how the design of these devices influence the users experience of themselves and their bodies beyond utility, efficacy and accuracy. The research product Ovum was designed to facilitate a DIY, shared, domestic experience, rather than an expert-led, individual, clinical experience of fertility tracking. Ovum uses the method of saliva sampling to determine ovulation. This paper unpacks the findings from a three-month long deployment of Ovum with seven couples trying to conceive. Besides an evaluation of the device in terms of the three experiential qualities aimed for in the design process, we report on the consequences of executing a design deployment that resembles a clinical trial. We contribute our experience in order to develop an understanding of how designing for the body places interaction designers in novel and complex situations.","authors":[{"institutions":["IT University of Copenhagen"],"personId":26141},{"institutions":["IT University of Copenhagen"],"personId":30617},{"institutions":["IT University of Copenhagen"],"personId":31347}]},{"title":"\"It Should Be a Game for Fun, Not Exercise\": Tensions in Designing Health-Related Features for Pokémon GO","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32668,"abstract":"Leveraging existing popular games such as Pokémon GO to promote health can engage people in healthy activities without sacrificing gaming appeal. However, little is known about what potential tensions arise from incorporating new health-related features to already existing and popular games and how to resolve those tensions from players' perspectives. In this paper, we identify design tensions surrounding the appeals of Pokémon GO, perspectives on different health needs, and mobile health technologies. By conducting surveys and design workshops with 20 avid Pokémon GO players, we demonstrate four design tensions: (1) diverse goals and rewards vs. data accuracy, (2) strong bonds between players and characters vs. gaming obsession, (3) collaborative play vs. social anxiety, and (4) connection of in-real-life experiences with the game vs. different individual contexts. We provide design implications to resolve these tensions in Pokémon GO and discuss how to extend our findings to the broader context of health promotion in location-based games.","authors":[{"institutions":["Seoul National University"],"personId":26799},{"institutions":["University of Washington"],"personId":30888},{"institutions":["University of Washington"],"personId":30909},{"institutions":["University of Washington"],"personId":30366}]},{"title":"FrownOnError: Interrupting Responses from Smart Speakers by Facial Expressions","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32669,"abstract":"In the conversations with smart speakers, misunderstandings of users' requests lead to erroneous responses. We propose FrownOnError, a novel interaction technique that enables users to interrupt the responses by intentional but natural facial expressions. This method leverages the human nature that the facial expression changes when we receive unexpected responses. We conducted a first user study (N=12) to understand users' intuitive reactions to the correct and incorrect responses. Our results reveal the significant difference in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of users' facial expressions between two conditions, and frowning and raising eyebrows are intuitive to perform and easy to control. Our second user study (N=16) evaluated the user experience and interruption efficiency of FrownOnError and the third user study (N=12) explored suitable conversation recovery strategies after the interruptions. Our results show that FrownOnError can be accurately detected (precision: 97.4\\%, recall: 97.6\\%), provides the most timely interruption compared to the baseline methods of wake-up word and button press, and is rated as most intuitive and easiest to be performed by users.","authors":[{"institutions":["Tsinghua University"],"personId":30693},{"institutions":["Tsinghua University; Ministry of Education"],"personId":30666},{"institutions":["Tsinghua University"],"personId":30369},{"institutions":["Tsinghua University"],"personId":28296},{"institutions":["Tsinghua University"],"personId":31345},{"institutions":["Tsinghua University; Ministry of Education"],"personId":27503}]},{"title":"Interacting with Literary Style through Computational Tools","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32670,"abstract":"Style is an important aspect of writing, shaping how audiences interpret and engage with literary works. However, for most people style is difficult to articulate precisely. While users frequently interact with computational word processing tools with well-defined metrics, such as spelling and grammar checkers, style is a significantly more nuanced concept. In this paper, we present a computational technique to help surface style in written text. We collect a dataset of crowdsourced human judgments of style, derive a model of style by training a neural net on this data, and present novel applications for visualizing and browsing style across broad bodies of literature, as well as an interactive text editor with real-time style feedback. We study these interactive style applications with users and discuss implications for enabling this novel approach to style.","authors":[{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":30400},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":28034},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":26404},{"institutions":["University of California, Berkeley"],"personId":28011}]},{"title":"Design Study \"Lite\" Methodology: Expediting Design Studies and Enabling the Synergy of Visualization Pedagogy and Social Good","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32671,"abstract":"Design studies are frequently used to conduct problem-driven visualization research by working with real-world domain experts.

Thus we present the Design Study \"Lite\" Methodology, a novel framework for implementing design studies with novice students in 14 weeks. We utilized the Design Study \"Lite\" Methodology in conjunction with Service-Learning to teach five Data Visualization courses and demonstrate that it benefits not only the students but also the community through service to non-profit partners.

We studied a biomolecular nano-design lab that works on a current frontier of science – RNA origami – whose researchers depend on computational tools to do their work, yet are not trained as programmers. Using a participatory design process, we developed a computational labbook to concretise what computational media could look like, using the principles of computability, malleability, shareability, and distributability suggested by previous work. We used this prototype to co-reflect with the nanoscientists about how it could transform their practice. We report on the computational culture specific to this research area; the scientists' struggles managing their computational environments; and their subsequent disempowerment yet dependence. Lastly, we discuss the generative potential and limitations of the four design principles for the future of computational media.","authors":[{"institutions":["Aarhus University"],"personId":29769},{"institutions":["Aarhus University"],"personId":26146},{"institutions":["Aarhus University"],"personId":28656},{"institutions":["Aarhus University"],"personId":30983}]},{"title":"To Write Code: The Cultural Fabrication of Programming Notation and Practice","trackId":10913,"typeId":11349,"tags":[],"keywords":[],"id":32673,"abstract":"Writing and its means have become detached.

In this paper, I recall the emergence of high-level notation for representing computation. I show how the earliest inventors of programming notations borrowed from various written cultural practices, some of which came into conflict with the constraints of digitizing machines, most prominently the typewriter. As such, I trace how practices of \"writing code\" were fabricated along social, cultural, and material lines at the time of their emergence. By juxtaposing early visions with the modern status quo, I question long-standing terminology, dichotomies, and epistemological tendencies in the field of computer programming. Finally, I argue that translation work is a fundamental property of the practice of writing code by advancing an intercultural lens on programming practice rooted in history.","authors":[{"institutions":["Cornell
